We're going to go through for the agenda we're going to go through just quick introductions I know that there's a lot of people asking who we are and so we're going to go through some introductions we're going to have the background of the defcon group's team minimum requirements and core values we're going to address some obstacles that we acknowledge that we're fighting as well and planned improvements and you know hopefully discuss other planned improvements during the discussion. And probably what everyone's here for these two following things changes the naming convention and point of contact verification we're going to go into those going to go into the details there and then we're going to open it up for discussions and questions so First off like I said I am at 915 I am the department lead leaf is here with us she is my second we also have Jason east St. everyone should know Jason he's been the voice of our program for years global ambassador globetrotter all over the place but Jason is here with us today as well we have deviled egg I don't believe she is here should other commitments but she serves as our volunteer coordinator in terms of volunteers for helping us and polo master is on well with technical operations of course our reporting structure we report to the dark tangent our fearless leader and then we also work with nikita's hand in hand and then sleep stack is our primary liaison on the defcon staff in terms of the next slide the deaf Congress and I'm I'm putting this as department the DC board label is a misnomer we are not a board I honestly don't know where the board label originated from but we are not aboard we function like any defcon other defcon department our positions are good positions in terms of our job we do meet weekly outside of con I know a lot of groups you know only concentrated around con but we do meet around the year we're tasked with we're tasked by defcon to organize support and foster growth of DCG programs and that's what we are trying to do 2 main things we we need to ensure that every DCG out there is meeting the minimum requirements we're going to talk about that in just a second and then also we're here to protect the defcon brand and the DCG brands and that's our community please do you want to take this one absolutely so I want to share with all of you our core values these are the things that we believe are central to defcon groups and first and foremost is our community and our autonomy local groups that are self organized and LED with flexibility and this is something that's important to us our groups have existed for over a couple of decades and though Adam and myself and the current members of the department are new to the organization relatively speaking this is something that's important to us and the reason why we got involved with this department in the 1st place is to keep these values central to our department and fostering the growth of defcon groups going forward the guidelines that we recently shared don't impact groups abilities to organize locally to self organize to remain flexible in the way that they are led and how they organize events and meetups in the future and secondary we want to continue to emphasize inclusivity and accessibility def con groups should always be open to all regardless of skill level background or any other descriptors hacker ethics and responsible exploration curiosity with respect legality and purpose are also central core values to Deacon groups transparency and trust is something else that is very important to us and we acknowledge that we're hearing your feedback we understand that you feel that we may have not exemplified this over the last couple of years especially and that clear communication is important and that is one of the reasons why we have reached out to defcon groups around the world within the last couple of years to do a pulse tech recently as a point of contact you may have received an e-mail from us to verify whether or not you're still active this was in an effort to restart communication between our team and defcon groups that were still active we also do not want to collect tons of data minimal data collection is something else that is very important to us and so we'll get into some of the things that are being collected in more detail a bit later but trust and transparency is also something that is a core value of ours and we believe that that extends to defcon groups as well at the local level and we're making commitments to be more transparent going forward as a department but from our perspective the transparency not only does it go both ways but it's something that I want to emphasize our lack of being out there and being very public I know that I'm one of the members who is more public but our lack of being public is not to be secretive more to prevent it from looking like we're out there trying to get attention or recognition for the work that we do our group and department is more about giving back to the community and supporting the needs of the community rather than seeking validation or accolades for the work that we do and finally on the core values collaboration over gatekeeping knowledge sharing and mutual support over exclusion this is something that personally in my own defcon group myself and pull master are point of contacts for local defcon groups this is something that's extremely important to us and it's important to each of the members of our department as well this idea that we want to spread defcon at a local level and make it accessible to those who are not able to attend the annual conference in Vegas and include and bring in folks in the emerging workforce as well as those who are perhaps transitioning into this space from other areas and out of more handed back to you OK thank you so the next thing next slide I'll go over is just the minimum requirements these are the things that when we're fielding requests for new groups when we're fielding complaints these are things they look at right these are what we expect the defcon groups out there to adhere to you know there's some discussion in the chat earlier um yes I did say from day one but it has been from the day I've taken over or I've I've been involved the the defcon code of conduct is always applied since I've been involved with defcon groups and in my discussions with Jason and DT that is the that is what I've been told so since the since the code of conduct was introduced um.com groups it applies to defcon groups as well as defcon so the code of conduct is not just a con at summer camp it applies to dot com groups as well so that is one thing that we expect and and right we expect that as a community we want we want to be good people we don't want bad apples in our bunch so I don't think that's that much to ask for a group to adhere to the code of conduct second thing here is maintain a verified point of contact that lives in the area that you're representing so one of the things that when we first started taking over the the department is that well one I'll just admit I'll talk about this in the next slide too is that we had pretty much you just say we didn't have any records previous records minimal and so there were a lot of people that had moved on that were inactive you name it they weren't we we were not able to contact them and so one of the that that of course makes our job difficult if we can't contact the POC if we can't hunt them down how do we do our job so one of the things that we felt in terms of going forward making DCG better making it where we can help better and provide more support is that we have to have a verified point of contact and then one of the other things that adds on to that that lives in the area they're representing we've had several instances of people that have complained that basically everyone know what domain squatting is right well people are sitting on these names of these groups they no longer live in the area they're representing people are trying to take over the groups but the point of contact that's there won't let it go and so we don't think that's what the intent of defcon groups is we think that you know if you move out if you move out of state and you're still trying to hold on to a group that you started you know five years ago and for the benefit of your company or personal benefit that's not right it should it belongs to the community so every group it belongs to community it doesn't belong to any said person or point of contact it belongs to the community this next item I know that we've had some questions some concerns about this one in terms of hold regular in person meetups and what we had discussed is that we think that in order to maintain group status and to live up to the intent of defcon groups we want you to meet once a quarter in person that doesn't mean the entire the entire DCG has to go somewhere and meet in person but that means that we want the point of contact to organize an in person meet up that maybe inviting to new people that people can get out of their house and come face to face and collaborate and work together now one of the other things in terms of meetups and meetings we've had lots of confusion in the past we've had lots of people that don't want to be point of contacts like well I don't I don't know any speakers I don't know content I don't know this I don't know that I can't I I don't have a place to hold my meeting when we're talking meetups so one let's get this on the record virtual meetups are fine so I know that that's been asked in in behind the scenes and the questions that I feel that virtual meetups are absolutely fun but once a quarter we want you to meet in person this doesn't have to be formal it can be hey we are meeting at Taco tico Friday at 5:00 come join us for some tacos drinks and discussion and so that's what we want we want people to get involved and engage with with each other that's the intent of Deacon groups and so holding that once 1/4 I believe is is fair in terms of asking groups to exist maintain existence and then another thing on this too that we've we've addressed is that you can coexist with other groups that the 26 hundreds the B sides it's about community and being involved we're not competing and so you know if if you have other groups going on in that I know that we have several points of contacts that are points of contacts and these other these other groups that's perfectly fine there's nothing wrong with that the next item in terms of an annual check in with defcon groups hey TTL are you still alive you know one of the things that has happened throughout the couple of decades of existence is that you sign up for a group and then we never hear from you again sometimes you know sometimes you need it sometimes you don't I know that there's been some comments in terms of we're nonexistent well one we're going to we're going to do better at that but two if you don't need us I mean you're operating fine on your own and so that's that's perfectly acceptable too we don't we don't wanna overstep we don't want to try to to control your group or other than these minimum requirements but function on your own as you have but we want that annual check in saying Yep I'm still here we're still active we're still good then the other things these are really core ensure meetings are free and inclusive free for all to attend no illegal activities or commercial exploitation the commercial exploitation comes with the free and I know that a lot of groups have asked can I have sponsors certainly you can you know Deacon we we don't want to be known as as an ad or you know a sales pitch that's not what it's about but if you have somebody that's wanting to sponsor food drink entertainment etcetera etcetera that is perfectly acceptable no strings attached though so if they want to sponsor that if you want to maybe set something up in the corner or something to recognize hey food and drink or sponsored by XYZ company tonight thank you know thank them for that that's fine but there cannot be any expectation of I have to listen to a sales pitch I have to give my name or number to attend this etcetera etcetera so commercial exploitation not going on there and then the brand and media guidelines this is in terms of making sure that defcon groups is not confused with defcon that's the biggest thing that that's one of the largest things that we fight is that a lot of groups out there and sometimes it's unintentional but a lot of groups out there sell themselves as defcon insert same here and insert country here and so far there's been defcon and defcon China there is no other defcon than that so that's one of the things that we always have to reach out to a lot of times if we're reaching out to you we are reaching out to say hey you're smart you're stepping on the defcon brand it creates brand confusion it creates confusion in our community ohh hey deacons doing a conference in in you know this country no we're not it's a local group we certainly encourage local meetups we certainly encourage groups to hold local events um but it has to be named appropriately to not cause confusion with defcon so talking about this current obstacles yes we've had communication barrier barriers lack of existence of records I would call this we're trying to reboot defcon groups we are trying to get good records on file so we can communicate so we can provide you better service support whatever you need and so it's been a struggle in terms of trying to weed out who is still functioning and who is still meeting with the new groups and the crisscross and it it's been difficult but we're at one point we just basically have said we have to just start over with a fresh set of records we need to verify people we need to get them on the books and and start clean this is from this point on this is our source of truth we can't go digging through the five different versions of spreadsheets that are incomplete that you know was handed to us by different defcon group leads but we we just it's such a disarray we just have to start fresh and so you know the lack of access we've we've had issues with being able to move as fast as we want on certain things but we are working with DC staff we've made lots of roads of improvement there I am excited about where we are headed uh and hope to have some new things introduced soon in inactive and unresponsive groups again you know we've reached out we've reached out we get we don't contact you sometimes we just have that we don't even have an e-mail for some groups you know some of them some of them we get lucky and we actually have an MDR bounce back to us but then some of them are just out there and not responsive and then you know there's also been groups that haven't even been on the list that have popped up and said yeah I've been a group since you know 2000 13 so we recognize this these are obstacles we are trying to do better we will do better and you know I think that we've talked about holding town hall forums in the past and all I can say is until today we've talked about it we haven't actually put that in motion so we put in motion it's great to see it looks like there's 87 people in the audience and all I can tell you is that we're here to listen and help and make things better So improvements and progress again as I've been saying better overall communications quarterly town hall meetings Forsyth has helped us greatly he's got it set up with a point of contact only channel in discord and so as we are verifying our new points of contact we are also getting your discord ID so we can add you to this channel this helps us greatly communicate quicker easier instead of me having to go log into VPN into a VM to a secure e-mail server that I don't always have access to when I'm traveling at this point in time I have I have verified contacts now and discord and my point of contacts that we can have discussions and also fosters discussions and and ideas between the points of contact so there's way for those points of contact to communicate easier amongst yourselves we I know that I know I'm going to get this in the chat I've been preaching the new website for years all I can say is that we've been trying to get a new website for years I think that it's finally coming around it's close I still think it's ambitious to say that we'll have a new one before con but that is our goal another thing is that we've been working with hacker tracker to we get our new data pushed over to that platform so it can be shared there as well and then something that we've always discussed and never has happened and I know it's been brought up in some of the chats is you know we'll work on the speaker resource pool to to help your groups with you know those groups that do want to have formal presentations stuff like that whether in person or virtually we'll work on a verified pool of speaker resources to help you with and that not only helps you but it also helps the speakers of our community there's lots of folks out there that need you know that that want to present that want to do research and it's not easy to get up on stage and get that so it's a good platform to to help promote people as well so we're looking forward to that all right things that we're here to really one one thing really really good one step back real quick with regards to the website we understand the frustration because everybody can make a website in a day however there are very strict guidelines that are enforced for websites that are connected to defcon assets like defcon groups for example and those guidelines make things a little trickier we're also working with defcon staff and the website team so in producing the content and working with their team there are some other steps in between making a website and getting to done that make it a little bit more complicated than just spinning up a website in a CMS and getting that posted so please bear with us I know that we're all sick of the excuses and we're trying to be as transparent as possible but we also can't throw shade at anyone else or throw anyone under the bus these are the you know guidelines that we have to work with and the restrictions that we have to operate within and while Adam and I our leads in this department we haven't been leads of this department for very long there have been many people involved in defcon groups over the last 20 some odd years and those people have also tried to make progress and struggled we're at a point we want to take responsibility for past failure learn from those lessons and attempt to navigate through the tricky waters that we have ahead of us but we also need community support and some grace in order to accomplish those things grace alright thanks Allie um OK what we're here what you know 2 two things coming up that we're we're here to really discuss the changes the changes to the naming convention so first and foremost going to put this in big bold letters existing groups are allowed to continue using their current name and identity I started to put like 3 slides in here but I didn't want to be condescending but no this was this was one of the things that was out at the very first when some of these changes hit publicly is that people thought that no we were going to be forced to go with a different name no we recognize that people have investments into branding merch tattoos all sorts of stuff right we don't want to take your identity away but we do want to come up with a naming convention that will allow us to grow the community allow us to add new groups and remove some of those some of those obstacles that we've been facing in terms of you know trying to bring on new groups so again just want to reiterate existing groups are allowed to continue using their parent group name and identity so why are we changing it's a direct result of outgrowing the dialing code international dialing codes ohh my gosh they are probably one of the biggest headaches that I've dealt with in the last few years I've tried figuring out an equation for some of the international groups that are applying and every time I think that I have an equation figured out or a system figured out it gets blown to shreds and so that's one of the frustration and the pain points that we said like hey why don't we just come up with a new system it provides consistency and searchability it allows more groups to coexist in close proximity and you know I I I I responded to one of these questions earlier in the the general chat but how how does this work and why are we coming up with this so for instance in very sparsely populated areas I'm going to take New Mexico for example they've got 2 area codes that cover the entire state we've got like 4 groups that want to exist there and so in the past that's meant DCG 512-1-2-3-4ABC D that just doesn't make any sense and so with this we are allowing groups to share and so yes they are going to represent that area code but they're going to represent the city Albuquerque Las Cruces Santa Fe etcetera again in and so that's in sparsely populated areas and then conversely in densely populated areas we have groups that are competing over one another that you know we can allow them now to have maybe maybe it takes an hour to get to the opposite side of the city but you know hey you've got a good group on the north side of the city South or east to West in little suburbs so this allows us to take that suburb or that smaller city name give you a group and not be restricted to area code dash ABC or 123 um you know here's an example I went and looked it up so you know DCG 011617 A sorry Brisbane don't wanna pick on you if we've got any representatives in here from from your group but I really think DCG has been is more effective in terms of identification for for people when when you're out and about when you're at con when you're wanting people to find you another thing that we've done is we've introduced group types one of the another one of the common complaints that we heard is that the the professionals in our industry or our community didn't really necessarily like being having a bunch of collegiate members and vice versa they have opposite facing ideas of what the group should be and and the content of that and it got to be to the point to where we had people just saying I'm not going to intend and you know we we had people saying that hey I want to take over this DCG in this town and I reached out to some of the people that I know in the community in that town and it's like if you do that that's going to turn into just all academic and no one's gonna lose interest and no one's gonna attend except for the college students and so this is meant to try to reach as many you know the the purpose of DCG is try to be inclusive and reach as many people as possible and again we've we've had this issue as well with some government entities um in terms of military bases etcetera etcetera so we are making some exceptions on that there will be some additional requirements required for academic and government groups I originally I'm I'm not very I'm not very creative I'm sorry I I saw this unread I read this on Reddit and people were complaining about the professional name hey I agree maybe I'm hoping instead of professional that the community would be a a better name for that in terms of a group type open to suggestions there but at this point community is probably the best thing that we've come up with I get you with professional so not throwing any shade there and then again new applications I don't care if it's what group type it is but new applications will be approved on a case by case basis a lot of times there is certainly just I don't like group in my area and I want to form my own group that is not what we want we want people working together so when we have requests come in to form a group on top of another we want to be respectful to that existing group we want to encourage this new point of contact requesting the group to reach out to the existing group in the area can you work together can you find a way to coexist and and be as one and then if not you know ultimately our job is to you know make defcon groups available and so we will give you know if we can't come to consensus we will give out another group but we do try to protect those existing groups and and as much as we can the existing groups are meant to be granular not regional we've had lots of people that take that that sense that if I get if you go register a DCG group that is the entire country that ohh that's going to come with the prestige and this is going to be this and that no that's not what we're about we want them to be regional we want them to be local we want them to be granular so we will not create quote UN quote super groups but what we will encourage is the groups that are in proximity to each other we will encourage hey work together contact you know communicate with 1 and I know a lot of you do I know there's examples of this out here but we do encourage that and we do love that idea and that concept of work together and then come together once a month say hey we're all gonna come to the center of the city we're all gonna meet here or there and and have a big group meeting right so granular meetings here and there and you know maybe area type meetings every once in a while would be awesome idea support that 100% OK I'm going to move on through this quickly so we can get to discussions point of contact verification so first and foremost I just wanna reiterate first and last name phone number e-mail address information is used and collected for defcon use only internal defcon use only it's not sold it's not put on the website this is this is meant for us to have a a valid confirmed communication channel with you should we need to reach your group um and I'm going to just have to start here I know that somebody said let's be real so we're going to be real Deacon groups is no longer a party it's involved into a community and that evolution into a community comes with responsibility and we have to have responsibility for growth in our community and we have to be responsible for the members in our community so one of the things that you know people people question well what does defcon groups give me for a lot of people it gives them automatic perception of being a leader in their industry and they use that to their advantage they use that to have endorsements and and bad faith actors and so we see this time and time again we work against it but it's sometimes we're chasing ghosts we've had people we've had people that we've disbanded that have come back with a different e-mail on a different name we've had that happen several times like now dude you look this is this is you again come on let's you know come on give us a little bit of credit here but in general we can't without some form of additional verification we cannot stop that from happening and so yes we closed one group down he comes back with a different name and a different e-mail and applies for a group and a neighboring city and then goes out and does the same damn thing and so you know this just helps us tried to prevent that and when I say protect the community a lot of people have questioned how are you going to protect the community you know we can't protect it in in in its entirety but we can at least try our best to make efforts to protect it so again let's be 100% honest yes these changes go to protect the reputation of defcon and the defcon groups community and what an action of one has the potential of affect us all and that's what we were seeing we don't want that to happen I know that one of the questions I saw I saw someone post that we see this as a liability for for for you guys in terms of being a group and that's why I asked it's like I I find a little bit of irony there is because that is what we are seeing too we may be coming at it from two different perspectives but we were for certain trying to reduce any liability and yes yes we're protecting have gone but we're protecting your group as well if you as a Deacon group out there are part of the defcon brand we're protecting all of us that is our intent we're not doing this to punish or control anyone you know that's we've we've read that online is that we don't want any control we don't want any centralization but you know at the end of the day if you're going to be operating under the defcon brand we at least need to know who you are in in you know be able to communicate with you and so again we're not trying to punish or control anyone and honestly we don't see how this affects how any groups are currently operating we're not asking anyone to operate any differently except for be connected with us and say hey I'm I'm here I'm here if you need me and at the same time we're here if you need us and final point on this is that the this change was not made as a result of the the recent lawsuit sure you can probably connect some dots there if you want to but this was this this was not a result of that lawsuit things that we've learned as we've been in this position reports of fake defcon conferences and then this is probably the most important thing out of all and this is the driving force behind this but reports of serious misconduct and I'm talking serious misconduct in terms of it makes code of conduct violations look like a game of Paddy OK people um and so again I reflect back to this role of credibility and people potentially using the brand the brand that that you're a part of to for their for their own personal and and and ugly purposes and so this was not isolated to any one group we've had I don't know how many reports of it throughout the the entire globe and so that's when we put our foot down and said we've got to do something so it is not acceptable or we ask ourselves is it acceptable to not know the identity of a point of contact in charge of a group representing defcon so direct complaints already said that so we I don't wanna I don't wanna seem cliche when I say this but I have been part of the hacker community for I believe 15 years now I understand our roots and I understand where we came from we've discussed like we've thrown around all sorts of different options and ultimately these were the things that that um and so we saw it received feedback from current point of contacts and ultimately once we arrived at the decision to make these changes they were brought to the DC staff and approved by T again I don't want to sound cliche it was a difficult choice but considering that this is our community and something that we're all a part of I think our team chose human first When it comes to when it came to some of these issues human 1st and hacker second we're still hackers but we're humans that heart and we can't let some of the things that going on continue so I've tried to rush through that as quickly as possible thank you for listening to that and we will turn this over to start fielding some questions here all right so I have a couple questions for me that I've noted from the chat the first question is um I think the question that's probably most relevant I'll start with this one first how do you protect the point of contact information and when you look at how do you protect it correct so that is going into I think we're using in in terms of reasonable protection right this isn't Fort Knox this isn't credit card data this is information that um you know quite honestly we give more information when we order Grubhub than what we're collecting but we do realize that this is you know your information and we are cognizant of that we are we will work as hard as we can to protect that and so right now it's being filled in a spreadsheet that is password protected and stored on defcon resources yeah the second question I'm going to paraphrase this a little bit just to make it a little bit more yeah I'm gonna paraphrase so how do you know that the person that you're verifying is the person that you're verifying so if I come to you to verify that I'm a POC and I give you the name Bob McKenzie how do you know that I am Bob McKenzie so this is something that we struggled with for I'm not exaggerating years so I've been a member of this department since just over 2 years ago but only recently one of the leads and we talked about how we would verify the identity of the people who were taking the point of contact position in a group because through receiving reports that point of contacts were acting in ways that were not acceptable by Deacon standards based on the code of conduct and the only way that we could figure to verify somebody's identification was with the government ID now we debated this heavily amongst ourselves and we took this point to people in the community that we have known for a long time who've been part of the death community for a long time and before discussing it with the dark tangent and other members of defcon staff and having this approved as a method of verifying point of contacts for defcon group leadership it was heavily debated amongst our team because we wanted to find another way yeah asking anybody to show us a government ID wasn't something that we were fans of we're trying to be real here and we're trying to be honest it wasn't something that made us happy but it was the only way that we could figure to verify somebody and their legitimate identification so that is what we settled on was a photo government issued ID to verify their name and talk to this comment right there that was one of the things that we discussed like hackers have never faked an ID before absolutely you realize we realize that right I want to be clear that absolutely no lawyers were involved in any of this decision making process there were no lawyers involved none of this had anything to do with any lawsuits whatsoever these were all decisions that were made by our department with the best interests of our community at heart as members of this community we genuinely want to help our community and protect the members of it and there were people coming to us asking for help legitimately reporting point of contacts who were behaving badly and without right next question go ahead sorry Yep ohh and that's good at least there's no way for me to share with you those details without doxing the victims and sharing more details than anyone here is just like justified to have but I want you to understand we are trying to be as transparent and open as possible and we don't appreciate the way that we're being treated but we are legitimately coming to you with all the reasons that we've tried to do this for the betterment of our community and without any animosity or negative feeling whatsoever and in fact I feel I saw it's called up since then but yeah in terms of the fake fake ID's yes you know if you go if somebody goes to those those links to to to face your identity for a defcon group I mean did we expect it to maybe happen or do we expect it to maybe happen it's been discussed but at the end of the day in in our hearts and our our our minds we're doing at least taking a step to try to prevent the things that we were seeing and try to try to prevent those from happening are we going to be 100% successful in doing that no but can we be 80% successful I think we can or more but we're we're doing our due diligence in terms of of of taking those steps to correct something that we see as bad and can I make a statement real quick right Adam 915 can I make a statement real quick yes I believe you have for Jason go for it OK I I've seen a lot of comments and you know it just reminded me the whole second rule of the Internet don't read the comments and I want to say a couple things that are that really hit me one is that I hear a lot of talk about brand I talk about liability like like defcon is getting something out of these defcon groups how much money has defcon asked for defcon group to give or contribute exactly what is the commercial aspect of defcon I've not seen one I was asked to be part of the defcon groups for 10 years ago by DT I started out global I spent thousands of dollars going through Southeast Asia because there was not enough representation at defcon groups or for hacker groups in that area it's like and I've done that where most of the conferences defcon I know has totally given thousands of dollars worth of merchandise for me to give out to defcon groups to send into packs not asking for anything money it's like defcon gets a lot of hackers every year before death count groups had started there was people attending defcon defcon group is a community I've gone to different cities and I've had people say well we've got a group here and my response is that is awesome that's what is important is to have a group I'm not trying to post whatever possibilities I'm not trying to like say you need a death conquer what you need is hackers need to have a human connection to know that they they're not alone it's like and they need to know that there's others out there that are like them that's what defcon groups is trying to provide it's like I've seen kids eyes light up in Marrakesh when I explained to them how they could start a defcon group there that they weren't alone that they were part of the global community they didn't even know about but it's like when I've talked to people about those things and to help help them to start that it's like that's what it is and someone said that defcon is not a community it's the hacker community defcon started my journey into the hacking community it gave me a family that I didn't know existed it's like I didn't have a place where I felt that I belonged until I ran into and I met people that were like me and that believed in the things that I believed and wanted to help me be part of that community it's like that's what defcon started out for me it's growing now and we look at this like it's like ohh we're we're being more corporate or we're being no we're trying to be more responsible for the people that have been hurt and we're being more responsible for the people that are looking to us for leadership on trying to say this is a place where I'm not going to be taken advantage of this is a place that is not trying to profit off of me this is a place that's not trying to do things like that this is a place where I can meet other hackers like me and learn from them and and and spitball with them it's like and and and and be a part of something there if you've got another a city set group an Isaac is an amazing group in New York City it's like I love going to that meet up every time I can when I'm in New York there's 2600 groups all over the world it's like I've attended them and it's like and I encouraged them it's not a competition we're not trying to make money off of this this is the only thing that we're doing and we're donating all this time is so the communities out there and the people out there have a place to realize that they're part of something and they're not alone that they have other hackers that believe like them and think like them and want to foster that kind of community it's like it's not about I'm not trying to protect the brand I'm trying to protect the people that go to this conference and the goes to the these groups who are trying to feel like this is what it's about it's like but there's been no marketing toward defcon about you know publicizing or or marketing off of def con groups there's no talk I've never heard once someone talk about the brand effect or the marketing impact or the money impact no one from defcon has ever questioned my request to bring gear and to bring swag from defcon at their cost and to freely give it out to groups all over the world not just in America everywhere I've given out Deacon group swag gift bags and stuff to Brazil to Russia to Paris to China to Singapore all over South Africa I have gone on every continent I've been on we have given out freely without reservation without any kind of strings attached without any kind of publicity or like ohh you you need to like now Rep defcon it's just the foster the community alright I'm gonna move on to the next question if you guys don't mind do you have anything else to add a pattern or Jason Nope alright cool so the next it's go ahead OK uh the next one I don't think it's necessarily a question but it is a statement that I caught in the chat that I think is probably worth addressing uh I think it was from the mop maybe but it was a but but an issue there is I think it's a little bit this phrase but basically the issue that that they're seeing is that it took them months to get any feedback when forming their group so there's this feeling that you you you can't acknowledge that you've demonstrated issues in the past you've demonstrated communication issues in the past you've been saying a lot of we're going to get better but it doesn't sound like you've taken accountability for the issues that that we've had in the past and I just wanted to see if you want to take a moment to address that Yep I I don't see how we haven't taken accountability for that the majority of this call or there's there's been lots of parts with this call that we have taken accountability we here look I I think I I think really when it comes down to is that yeah we have had a lot of problems in the past DCG has been non communicative I I personally like as someone who's ran vendors and other areas of defcon I personally been frustrated with some of the communication with Deacon groups but from Adam and Alice this is this is their first and second year running defenders we actually brought them in to try to help address some of these issues and and I mean that's a lot of what you're seeing as part of like like writing down our values and making sure that all of that is is is out there I think absolutely some groups had communication problems that is 100% true but we have full faith in Adam and Elise to kind of correct that ship I think that's that that's kind of what what I think is probably representative of our feelings on on that hopefully that resonates well some of the people who felt like we weren't taking that accountability well Kevin I'm gonna tell you right now if we didn't care or if we weren't taking accountability or trying to make things better we wouldn't be here right now and it's not just the leaf and myself it's Jason it's polo master chef deviled egg we're here as a team the one of the biggest things that I've I've had help from from Kevin as well in terms of the staff we've we've become like I I feel that for for many years we've sort of operated on our own it's like hey you guys are out there doing your own thing OK but as of as of the last couple of years Nikita and darrington like polybius and and Kevin have made an effort to include and that has been greatly beneficial for us because now we feel that we have some some avenues to get those answers to get those problems taken care of and that's what we're trying that's what we're trying to do no excuses uh yes I completely agree with your frustrations I hear you I'm not I'm not overlooking those or minimizing those but we're we're here to to try to do that and yes I told you defcon 31 that we didn't have access to the website we don't even have a website right now it was taken down and transferred into the forums which are absolutely hard to navigate hard to find anything but we have had some discussions so part of part of some talk in the community part of the the the waves that you guys been making have actually helped and you know it's like we are we are on track like I said hopefully I'm I'm keeping my fingers crossed to have a website launched before con this year no promises right and we're trying to go ahead I'm going to go ahead I'm going to go and bring lease up the requested just to make a comment I think it's completely fair to view at least you want to send that request again or aisles I I'm not sure that's L and I to be honest I sent them an invite me product that's assault public right everybody hear me I I'd like to thank you all at the start for the opportunity to speak in regards to this entire situation I know it's been quite difficult for probably everybody it's as somebody that has dealt with defcon internals like I I know it's got to be quite difficult but I I do want to bring up grave concerns in regard to that the steps that you all have made in this community I think a good idea if possible would be would be to make an affirmative statement just to give you all advice that that that none of you are making any money on regard you know in regards to you're not paying employees you're volunteers um it seems like that's the case you know being part of this conversation but I I do believe for y'all sake that be good affirmative statement to make I just forwarded to you I am yeah I'm aware of all that but my biggest concern honestly what what I would love to to touch on but you all have to an extent during this conversation I appreciate it is is that I I feel like I've been running an organization for many years right without the input of death conquers I I feel like I've cultivated a community and you know it's higher kind of you know small group it's through years and years of work I I run an entire B sides conference in regards to that and then a couple of weeks ago I get this random ping that dev groups once my ID right just to look at the situation from my perspective and it it makes me gravely concerned especially looking at the legal background of what defcon has been dealing with the hack new lawsuit everything else I understand that's not you know directly evolve def car groups but as a potential point of contact the organization I you know I have a lot of concerns with giving up my docs and the ask to do that I feel like it's just so antithetical to our culture as a whole right When I first got you know access to this channelwhenthe.com group I already did it I looked through the whole thing and I would like to apologize first and foremost because I feel like there are certain people throughout the situation that are acting in bad faith that are being extremely disrespectful in their conversations and I really do apologize to that but at the same time I I feel like that death card is taking advantage of me an organization that I've spent years cultivating in a for profit organization all decided you know all of a sudden decided to show up and apply rules to how I try to apply rules I might add to to how I am you know running my group after I had emailed for years and years and years and years I'm trying to get some support and I just I just don't feel like the liability involved and and I I know I bring that up and Jason he they're rightfully brought that up your explanation when I bring up the idea of a liability right holding my conversation here I feel like you all are being exploited if you are truthfully working for defcon to cultivate this community without pay without money I understand why you have been so hard to reach but if you're working for this organization with pay the response that I've received from my community even dealing with bad organizations is an absolute embarrassment on the name of Deacon and the idea the rhetoric that I continuously see and the Deacon DCG group is that there's this Deacon community I want to make it extremely clear there is no def con community there's a hacker community right and we support you you do not support us we provide value to the hacker community not the death community right death concept corporation actors or community of people that love each other and have you know because society deals and that is the rhetoric that consistently bothers me coming from the idea that that the people on this board are are working under the intention for free no I'm I'm sorry that that must not be the case or you all are being misled if this organization defcon groups wants to move forward this board must be dismantled and free fair and open elections and regards to how we move forward with defcon groups must be held so I'll take this quickly thank you for your time and figure out how is how is your your name pronounced is it i's I just wanna make sure we're saying the name right Adam go ahead OK so in terms of the main question one of the main questions there are we paid technically in terms of legal terms goons are not volunteers but the only pay that I have ever received from defcon is in the form of and just just recently after gooning for over 10 years I believe I've gotten one free hotel room out of it and some food tokens and a badge so that is our pay is a good batch a hotel room to stay at while we're at con in terms of we get one night per every night we work and and food tokens so that's our pay and I-100 I 100% am in this look I'm part of the hacker community the hacker community has provided so much for me this is my way of giving back I may not be some super hacker and in the weeds of the technical and finding 0 days and everything but this is my way this is the way of the members on our board to give back to the community to help support them we are trying to make this better this was an absolute dumpster fire when it was thrown in our laps and we were trying to make it right it doesn't happen overnight which which pains me because I am an impatient person but there are things that we have to work within and we have to abide by the absolutely slows us down now I recognize the fact that you you and so many others I'm not I'm not discounting anyone else on this call but yes there are lots of awesome and great groups out there that are the result of lots of hard work by people just like you to to build up that community and bring that community together and that's that that's what makes our community great you were giving back just like we are trying to do as well um and I mean the only way that I can think about this is that you know I alluded to it it's no defcon is no longer a party in the desert yes it is a for profit entity we are not trying to to make profit off of you off of off of anyone's work in the community but we've evolved we've evolved as a community and I cannot sit back as a human being and watch things happen and not take actions so 100% I'm going to try to do the right thing that any good human being is going to do in this industry and I would certainly hope that a good human being like as a hacker as part of the hacker community that we would be even above that and make sure that our people are being protected from predators out there they're trying to take advantage of those people so I cannot sit back in good faith and turn a blind eye and look the other way without doing something about that so yes we understand that this is a this is a paradigm shift from the hacker ethos and the anonymity and the the the DCG you know area code numbers but we've changed and we have to adapt and protect our people as we change we understand that there are people that don't like this change or don't agree with this change we understand that we respect that we encourage those other ecosystems it's not all about defcon groups it's about the community so if there is another ecosystem that serves members out there better we're not against that the B sides I mean all these other groups that happened during summer camp they're there for a reason and they serve their purpose and they serve people in different ways that people need so if that is what people need we 100% encourage that because that makes us better as a community Jason where you want to say something sorry I I want to apologize it's like I'm not afraid to admit when I was wrong I want it to be 100% stated and understood 10 years ago when I was asked to be the lead for def con groups I am not a organized person I am not good with business I'm not good with professionalism I I have executive function I'm on this part I am I thought it sounded cool to be an advisor because I needed people to help me with the organization part of it I was tasked to be like you're the guy to help with that program and I'm like I don't know what I'm doing I need someone more adulterer than me to to do the adulting thing that's like one of the first things I did as when I was asked to lead the defcon groups was to find someone to be the title that I created the defcon group's global coordinator which was basically the person who could make the decision so I wouldn't feel to be able to I couldn't do it it's like I could come up I'm good with coming up with ideas I'm good with helping with stuff but I am not good with making any of it happen it's like Advisory Board was not made to sound but it was because it was a corporate entity or it was not considered or or thought about it was I thought it I came up with it because I just like ohh well I need to call or something and you know when you get the people together and it sounds official it's like you know the board because that's in my mind that's what I thought I'm the one that screwed that up and made that happen it's like it's never been a a every person on this Advisory Board is a hacker is a volunteer who's committed to helping this community and I understand what we say the hacker community is the thing and it's like and and defcon is just part of that tribe like defcon is just one event that happens in the desert and I've said that before it's like we're the temple that comes up there it's like and we meet and there's all these other tribes that meet under that tent pole you've got the Wi-Fi hackers and the lock picking hackers and the hardware hackers the social engineering hackers and you've got the the tamper evident hackers you've got all these different hacking prides that meet up in this once a year but it's all together we're all hackers and we're all part of that community and we spread that out locally it's like when I talk about advertising and when people are saying like we're advertising for defcon he's like I don't that's not what I see is is the goal for death count groups it doesn't matter about the label it's about the community it's help finding people in your community so I am sorry that I called it a board I didn't know better I didn't know this was going to happen I didn't know I was still going to be around 10 years later to see all the stuff that was going on and to see it grow like this it's like I am thankful every day for Adam 915 and the lead and all the other people that actually took up the slack and actually started with them you want to know why the first five years of or like you know 10 years ago but 10 through 5 years ago my was so hard to get people contact because I didn't have that many people and I didn't know what to do and how to get it all streamlined it's like it was a mess and blamed me for that as well it's like that's my fault it's like I should have done a better job it's like one of the best decisions I made was to give it to someone that was doing it it's like I am 100% in agreement with every person's frustration and and disappointment when it comes to how slow responses have come from these group of volunteers and it's like but I am telling you that these last two years has been people dedicated only on trying to make it better to streamline it to make it better not to make it more profitable not to make it more marketable to make it better for the community to make it better for the groups so there is a better and faster response that's what we're trying so I want to just make sure that we understand that I'm sorry it's like I'm sorry that we had the connotations that it was a corporate or it was a board or it was anything like anything but a just a regular department like all the other goon departments just like the sock goons just like the network goons just like all the other goons the info booth goons the speaker OPS goons all the other quartermaster rooms all the other important goons that make defcon work and that's all I'm gonna say I'm sorry and then just one just one quick quick one add on here is that in terms of this this town hall is the first step to start eliciting feedback from the community we hear you we're going to do that and and my words to be better from here Kev please alright I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it fire some questions so there I believe there was like one or two people who wanted the couple opened speak we can do that we are going to limit the time to like one or two minutes same thing with the answers we're going to try to get this thing we're going to try to get through as much as we can so one question was what does a legal name solve that a verified e-mail or mobile number can't I don't I don't know if you guys contemplated that during your during your discussion about legal names and IDs I think like I can get a new e-mail address and a mobile number pretty easily like I don't know I have a couple apps on my phone that can do that so I can't get a legal name that easy yeah I mean I think it's I think it's about effort like the ideas of best effort you know that's that's what we can really ask for cool uh another question was Adam mentioned the continuous reports of CSC violations and worse and nefarious actions continuously being brought to our attention the transparency report only mentioned 2 DCG enforcement actions that I recall are you getting flooded with false reports or are enforcement actions being published well that's what clarity around the metadata there yeah yeah that's a good question so there's a lot of things that we don't have records of who this person is so we it's hard to go it's hard to go start tracking those down the transparency report one like I said we've sort of been off in our own island for several years and now we've been brought into other groups we are actively working with the hotline and sock team to be part of the transparency report we don't we don't view ourselves the the role of Deacon groups is to not enforce any code of conduct violation actions it is our is our duty to vet them to ensure that it's not something just absolutely bogus like I'm not going to I'm not going to send a complaint over of somebody squabbling over a town name or whatever DCG name but if it's a if it's a serious violation we're in works to have the the Socceroos the hotline goons handle that that's not our role that's their role and then they they investigate they look into that and ultimately any action out of that is DT's decision something else that we're talking about doing is having a mini defcon groups type transparency report and sharing that information with the community at defcon and and during closing ceremonies if that's something that sounds good to you all let us know um you know how many incidents we've had what types of incidents have been reported what types of activities we're handling the tasks that we process on an annual basis we work 365 days a year in this department not just for con but we also host the community space and have been extremely grateful to have square footage at defcon the last two deacons and we're bringing the community back this year in room 237 and I'm myself and polo master and other members of the department we're investing our personal money in bringing new equipment and new things and activities to engage the community in that community space this is um something that we're very passionate about and we want to help give everyone visibility into the work that we do if that's something you want to hear about so if a transparency report and getting up on stage at closing ceremonies to tell you what it is we actually do would be something that you're interested in please let us know alright awesome there was another question uh I think it might have been answered in chat I don't know exactly what it means what category of issues does the department see coming up in local groups that shouldn't be handled by LE and can be handled slash assisted remotely I don't know what Ellie is so there are there are various complaints about how groups are managed who's in charge of a group what members or point of contacts are doing in groups that are unacceptable by the other members standards in bad taste those things do not qualify as items that should be reported to law enforcement for example if a point of contact is extorting the members of their group or money for membership to the defcon group which is something that has been reported to us that is not something that we would report to law enforcement for example but if somebody in a Deacon group is doing something that breaks a local law then of course that is something that should be reported to law enforcement but we have trouble doing that if we can't identify the individual who is committing that crime to put it bluntly so that is one of the reasons for identification and verification of point of contact so that we have somebody that we can contact that could potentially help us to identify the member of the group that has committed the crime and help us to report that person to law enforcement and there are occasions where you know a law enforcement case would be opened and law enforcement would handle it but then in tandem that will be reported to defcon hotline team who will investigate it and decide whether that is something that needs to be handled on the defcon side if you committed a crime you can't be a defcon point of contact anymore and so it would be handled on both sides of the fence basically alright awesome well that was the that was all of the questions that I was able to catch in the chat ohh I guess one other question is where will the slide deck be available for everybody I also do use my real name it's on my LinkedIn I'm not hiding all of the people who are a member of this department have DCG in front of their handles we're here on LinkedIn or we're here on discord you can find us on LinkedIn I there was there was one more question I'm just waiting ohh yeah there was one resources are there for defcon groups and what benefits are provided by DCG and I guess if you have some that are planned you can talk about those it seems like a road map is something that people would be very interested in having and this is this is where we we want to hear your input we want we want to hear input of what the benefits are I mean other than legitimacy of being part of defcon we know that that's sure that's there a lot of people take advantage of that it led lynn's credibility but you know I love what debt room is we want to hear that like he says we I'm totally 100% and I think we can do that when he talks about help sourcing speakers advertising events I've tried to retweet whenever I see a defcon group meeting showing up I think we should have an actual organized thing where it's like where there is a actual place that we can submit when you've got a Deacon group announcement that you want to go out onto social media that we should be able to contact someone from the def con groups channel that they can then blast that to the social media for the defcon groups social media handles and help amplify those messages it's like I think those are both very good ideas and I think that those are very attainable very I can't say quickly because once again I can talk but it's like it's going to take others to do the work but I do hear you know room on that I think we should have a resource speakers and I've had several def con groups come to me over the years who've asked me to speak virtually or in person at their death con groups I have never said no and I'm sure Casey and the league and like several other members will be able are willing to do that I think we can get a lot more speakers that are willing to be available and make themselves available to to the defcon groups but also I want to make sure that we understand I think it's a wonderful opportunity for the local hackers at these defcon group meetings to give a talk because they have every one of those that attend those meetings have a talk to give they have something they can share with the community with themselves with another conference and I think they should start off by giving the talk at their local local death, group start understanding how to give the best presentation getting feedback from your friends and colleagues and peers locally and then starts applying to sides and then start applying to other conferences and apply to defcon to speak at those conferences that's one of the biggest key things defcon groups should be about is getting people participating and contributing to the community and sharing information and and and learning how to share that information with others so I think that's one of the key things that we should do Oh yeah I mean it sounds like uh there's opportunities for a lot of different benefits that come from this so I know that we're going to be having that the DCG POC text channel if you don't have human plus reach out to elite and Adam they can get you that human plus code so you guys can get into the POC only tax channel had to be fired you're fine um the if you're here you already have that code to gain access to the DCG POC channel you'll need to complete the verification process for POC and you can reach out to me to schedule that alright awesome well I think that that wraps up our time it's been around an hour and a half that's going to wrap up our time feel free to continue to have a discussion we'll try to be around to answer those questions for as long as we can um yeah thanks everybody thank you elif Adam Jason Polly like thank you guys for helping out and thanks for everyone in chat for you know giving that feedback and helping DCG become better and become what you guys wanted to be as well as you know what we can make it yeah appreciate it thanks everyone thanks to the goons who helped mod this we appreciate the community for showing up and for listening and for giving us your feedback as well genuinely thank you absolutely thank you everyone and for next room and for anyone else to continue this conversation we could probably do it in the DEG stage public we're already here so if you want to continue the talk we'll try to be as attentive as we can in this it's this one that the one you're currently typing in.
