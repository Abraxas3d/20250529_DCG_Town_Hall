### DCG Town Hall
#### Meeting held on DEFCON Discord 
#### 29 May 2025 1600 Pacific time

*Adam*

We're going to go through for the agenda, we're going to go through just quick introductions. I know that there's a lot of people asking who we are, and so we're going to go through some introductions. We're going to go through the background of the DEFCON group's team and then the minimum requirements and core values. We're going to address some obstacles that we acknowledge that we're fighting as well, and planned improvements. And hopefully discuss other planned improvements during the discussion period. And probably what everyone's here for these two following things: Changes to the naming convention and point of contact verification we're going to go into those, going to go into the details there, and then we're going to open it up for discussions and questions.

So first off like I said I am Adam915 I am the department lead. Alethe (Denis) is here with us. She is my second. We also have Jason Street. Everyone should know Jason he's been the voice of our program for years global ambassador globetrotter all over the place but Jason is here with us today as well. We have Deviled Egg I don't believe she is here, she had other commitments, but she serves as our volunteer coordinator. In terms of volunteers for helping us, and Polo Master is on well with technical operations. Of course our reporting structure, we report to the Dark Tangent, our fearless leader, and then we also work with Nikita hand in hand. And then Sleestak is our primary liaison on the DEFCON staff. In terms of the next slide, the DEFCON Groups, and I'm putting this as a department, the DC board label is a misnomer. We are not a board. I honestly don't know where the board label originated from. But, we are not a board. We function like any other DEFCON department. Our positions are Goon positions. In terms of our job we do meet weekly outside of DEFCON. I know a lot of groups you know only concentrated around con but we do meet around the year. We're tasked by DEFCON to organize support and foster growth of DCG programs. And that's what we are trying to do. Two main things, we need to ensure that every DCG out there is meeting the minimum requirements. We're going to talk about that in just a second. And then also we're here to protect the DEFCON brand, and the DCG brands, and that's our community. Alethe do you want to take this one?

*Alethe Denis*

Absolutely. So I want to share with all of you our core values. These are the things that we believe are central to DEFCON groups. And first and foremost is our community and our autonomy. Local groups that are self-organized and lead with flexibility. This is something that's important to us. Our groups have existed for over a couple of decades and though Adam and myself and the current members of the department are new to the organization relatively speaking. This is something that's important to us, and the reason why we got involved with this department in the first place, is to keep these values central to our department and fostering the growth of DEFCON groups going forward. The guidelines that we recently shared don't impact groups abilities to organize locally, to self-organize, to remain flexible in the way that they are led and how they organize events and meetups in the future. And, secondary, we want to continue to emphasize inclusivity and accessibility. DEFCON groups should always be open to all regardless of skill level background or any other descriptors. Hacker ethics and responsible exploration, curiosity with respect, legality, and purpose are also central core values to DEFCON groups. Transparency and trust is something else that is very important to us, and we acknowledge that we're hearing your feedback. We understand that you feel that we may have not exemplified this over the last couple of years, especially. And, that clear communication is important. And, that is one of the reasons why we have reached out to DEFCON groups around the world within the last couple of years to do a pulse tech, recently. As a point of contact you may have received an e-mail from us to verify whether or not you're still active. This was in an effort to restart communication between our team and DEFCON groups that were still active. We also do not want to collect tons of data. Minimal data collection is something else that is very important to us. And so we'll get into some of the things that are being collected in more detail a bit later. But, trust and transparency is also something that is a core value of ours and we believe that that extends to DEFCON groups as well, at the local level. And, we're making commitments to be more transparent going forward as a department. But, from our perspective, the transparency, not only does it go both ways but it's something that I want to emphasize our lack of being out there and being very public? I know that I'm one of the members who is more public, but our lack of being public is not to be secretive more to prevent it from looking like we're out there trying to get attention or recognition for the work that we do. Our group and department is more about giving back to the community and supporting the needs of the community rather than seeking validation or accolades for the work that we do. And, finally, on the core values, collaboration over gatekeeping, (and) knowledge sharing and mutual support over exclusion. This is something that personally in my own DEFCON group myself and Pole Master are point of contacts for local DEFCON groups this is something that's extremely important to us and it's important to each of the members of our department as well. This idea that we want to spread DEFCON at a local level and make it accessible to those who are not able to attend the annual conference in Vegas and include and bring in folks in the emerging workforce, as well as those who are perhaps transitioning into this space from other areas. And Adam I’ll hand it back to you.

*Adam*

OK thank you. So the next thing next slide I'll go over is just the minimum requirements. These are the things that when we're fielding requests for new groups, when we're fielding complaints, these are things they look at right? These are what we expect the DEFCON groups out there to adhere to. 

I know there's some discussion in the chat earlier, yes I did say from day one, but it has been from the day I've taken over or when I've been involved. The DEFCON code of conduct is always applied since I've been involved with DEFCON groups. And, in my discussions with Jason and DT, that is what I've been told. So, since the code of conduct was introduced, it applies to DEFCON groups as well as DEFCON. So, the code of conduct is not just at CON, at summer camp, it applies to DEFCON groups as well. So that is one thing that we expect.  And, we expect that as a community. We want to be good people. We don't want bad apples in our bunch. So I don't think that's that much to ask for a group to adhere to the code of conduct. 

Second thing here is (for groups to) maintain a verified point of contact that lives in the area that you're representing. So one of the things that when we first started taking over the department is that, well, one, I'll just admit, I'll talk about this in the next slide too, is that we had pretty much, you can say we didn't have any records. The previous records were minimal, and so there were a lot of people that had moved on, that were inactive, you name it. We we were not able to contact them. Of course makes our job difficult, if we can't contact the POC, if we can't hunt them down, how do we do our job? So one of the things that we felt in terms of going forward making DCG better making it where we can help better and provide more support is that we have to have a verified point of contact. And, then one of the other things that adds on to that that lives in the area they're representing. We've had several instances of people that have complained that basically - everyone knows what domain squatting is right? Well people are sitting on these names of these groups. They no longer live in the area they're representing. People are trying to take over the groups. But the point of contact that's there won't let it go. And so, we don't think that's what the intent of DEFCON groups is. We think that if you move out of state and you're still trying to hold on to a group that you started, you know, five years ago, and for the benefit of your company, or personal benefit, that's not right. It belongs to the community. So, every group, it belongs to the community. It doesn't belong to any said person or point of contact. It belongs to the community. 

This next item, I know that we've had some questions and some concerns about this one, in terms of hold regular in person meetups. And, what we had discussed is that we think that in order to maintain group status and to live up to the intent of DEFCON groups? We want you to meet once a quarter in person. That doesn't mean the entire the entire DCG has to go somewhere and meet in person, but that means that we want the point of contact to organize an in person meet up, that, may be inviting to new people, that people can get out of their house, and come face to face, and collaborate, and work together. 

Now, one of the other things in terms of meetups and meetings we've had lots of confusion in the past we've had lots of people that don't want to be point of contacts, like well I don't I don't know any speakers. I don't know content. I don't know this. I don't know that. I don't have a place to hold my meeting. When we're talking meetups? Let's get this on the record. Virtual meetups are fine. So I know that that's been asked about behind the scenes and the questions that I feel that virtual meetups are absolutely fine. But once a quarter we want you to meet in person. This doesn't have to be formal. It can be hey we are meeting at Taco Tico Friday at 5:00. Come join us for some tacos drinks and discussion. And, so that's what we want. We want people to get involved and engage with with each other. That's the intent of DEFCON groups. And so holding that once a quarter, I believe is fair in terms of asking groups to exist. Maintain existence. 

And then another thing on this too that we've addressed is that you can coexist with other groups. The 2600s, the BSides. It's about community and being involved. We're not competing. And so, you know, if you have other groups going on in that, I know that we have several points of contacts that are points of contacts in these other groups. That's perfectly fine. There's nothing wrong with that. 

The next item in terms of an annual check in with DEFCON groups. Hey, TTL (time to live), are you still alive? One of the things that has happened throughout the couple of decades of existence is that you sign up for a group and then we never hear from you again. Sometimes you know sometimes you need us, sometimes you don't. I know that there's been some comments in terms of that we're nonexistent. Well, one, we're going to we're going to do better at that. But two, if you don't need us, I mean you're operating fine on your own, and so that's that's perfectly acceptable too. We don't we don't wanna overstep. We don't want to try to control your group, other than these minimum requirements. But function on your own as you have, but we want that annual check in saying “Yep I'm still here we're still active we're still good”.

Then the other things? These are really core. Ensure meetings are free and inclusive, free for all to attend, no illegal activities or commercial exploitation. The commercial exploitation comes with the free. And I know that a lot of groups have asked “can I have sponsors?” Certainly, you can. You know DEFCON we we don't want to be known as an ad, or you know a sales pitch, that's not what it's about. But if you have somebody that's wanting to sponsor food drink entertainment etcetera etcetera that is perfectly acceptable. No strings attached though. So if they want to sponsor that, if you want to maybe set something up in the corner or something to recognize hey food and drink or sponsored by XYZ company tonight thank you know thank them for that that's fine, but there cannot be any expectation that I have to listen to a sales pitch, or that I have to give my name or number to attend this etcetera etcetera. So commercial exploitation not going on there. 

And then the brand and media guidelines. This is in terms of making sure that DEFCON Groups is not confused with DEFCON. That's the biggest thing. That's one of the largest things that we fight is that a lot of groups out there, and sometimes it's unintentional, but a lot of groups out there sell themselves as DEFCON insert name here and insert country here. And so far there's been DEFCON and DEFCON China. There is no other DEFCON than that. So that's one of the things that we always have to reach out to a lot of times. If we're reaching out to you, we are reaching out to say, hey you're stepping on the DEFCON brand, it creates brand confusion, it creates confusion in our community. 

“Ohh hey DEFCON’s doing a conference in in you know this country?” 

“No, we're not. It’s a local group.” 

We certainly encourage local meetups. We certainly encourage groups to hold local events. But, it has to be named appropriately, to not cause confusion with DEFCON. 
So talking about this current obstacles, yes we've had communication barriers. Lack of existence of records. I would call this we're trying to reboot DEFCON groups. We are trying to get good records on file, so we can communicate, so we can provide you better service, support whatever you need. And so it's been a struggle in terms of trying to weed out who is still functioning and who is still meeting with the new groups, and the crisscross, and it it's been difficult. At one point we just basically have said we have to just start over with a fresh set of records. We need to verify people, we need to get them on the books, and and start clean. From this point on this is our source of truth. We can't go digging through the five different versions of spreadsheets that are incomplete that you know was handed to us by different DEFCON group leads. It's in such a disarray, we just have to start fresh. And, so you know, the lack of access, we've had issues with being able to move as fast as we want on certain things, but we are working with DC staff. We've made lots of roads of improvement there. I am excited about where we are headed. I hope to have some new things introduced soon. Inactive and unresponsive groups? Again, you know, we've reached out. We've reached out. We don't contact you. Sometimes we just don’t even have an e-mail for some groups. You know, some of them some of them we get lucky and we actually have an NDR bounce back to us but then some of them are just out there and not responsive. And then you know there's also been groups that haven't even been on the list that have popped up and said yeah I've been a group since you know 2013. So, we recognize this. These are obstacles. We are trying to do better. We will do better. And you know, I think that we've talked about holding town hall forums in the past. And all I can say is until today we've talked about it and we haven't actually put that in motion. So, we put it in motion. It's great to see. It looks like there's 87 people in the audience, and all I can tell you is that we're here to listen and help and make things better. So improvements and progress. Again, as I've been saying, better overall communications, quarterly town hall meetings. Riverside has helped us greatly. He's set up a points of contact only channel in Discord. So as we are verifying our new points of contact we are also getting your Discord ID so we can add you to this channel this helps us greatly communicate quicker easier instead of me having to go log into a VPN into a VM to a secure e-mail server that I don't always have access to when I'm traveling. At this point in time I have I have verified contacts now in Discord and my point of contacts that we can have discussions and also fosters discussions and ideas between the points of contact. So there's a way for those points of contact to communicate easier amongst yourselves. I know I'm going to get this in the chat I've been preaching the new website for years. All I can say is that we've been trying to get a new website for years. I think that it's finally coming around. It's close. I still think it's ambitious to say that we'll have a new one before DEFCON, but that is our goal. 

Another thing is that we've been working with Hacker Tracker to get our new data pushed over to that platform so it can be shared there as well. And then something that we've always discussed and never has happened, and I know it's been brought up in some of the chats, is that we’ll work on a speaker resource pool to help groups that do want to have formal presentations and stuff like that, whether in person or virtually. We'll work on a verified pool of speaker resources to help you with. And that not only helps you but it also helps the speakers of our community. There's lots of folks out there that want to present, that want to do research. It's not easy to get up on stage and give that. So it's a good platform to to help promote people as well. So we're looking forward to that. 

*Alethe*

One step back real quick with regards to the website? We understand the frustration because everybody can make a website in a day. However, there are very strict guidelines that are enforced for websites that are connected to DEFCON assets like DEFCON groups for example. And those guidelines make things a little trickier. We're also working with DEFCON staff and the website team. So in producing the content and working with their team there are some other steps in between making a website and getting to done, that make it a little bit more complicated than just spinning up a website in a CMS and getting that posted. So please bear with us. I know that we're all sick of the excuses. And we're trying to be as transparent as possible. But we also can't throw shade at anyone else or throw anyone under the bus. These are the, you know, guidelines that we have to work with and the restrictions that we have to operate within. And while Adam and I are leads in this department we haven't been leads of this department for very long. There have been many people involved in DEFCON groups over the last 20-some odd years, and those people have also tried to make progress and struggled. We're at a point we want to take responsibility for past failure, learn from those lessons, and attempt to navigate through the tricky waters that we have ahead of us. But we also need community support and some grace in order to accomplish those things. 

*Adam*

Thanks Alethe. Two things coming up that we're here to really discuss are changes to the naming convention. So first and foremost going to put this in big bold letters, existing groups are allowed to continue using their current name and identity. When some of these changes hit publicly, people thought that no we were going to be forced to go with a different name. No, we recognize that people have investments into branding. Merch,  tattoos, all sorts of stuff. We don't want to take your identity away, but we do want to come up with a naming convention that will allow us to grow the community, allow us to add new groups, and remove some of those some of those obstacles that we've been facing in terms of you know trying to bring on new groups. So again, just want to reiterate, existing groups are allowed to continue using their parent group name and identity. So why are we changing? It's a direct result of outgrowing the dialing code. International dialing codes? Oh my gosh they are probably one of the biggest headaches that I've dealt with in the last few years. I've tried figuring out an equation for some of the international groups that are applying and every time I think that I have an equation figured out or a system figured out it gets blown to shreds. And so that's one of the frustration and the pain points so we said hey why don't we just come up with a new system? It provides consistency and searchability. It allows more groups to coexist in close proximity. And you know, I responded to one of these questions earlier in the the general chat, but how how does this work and why are we coming up with this? So for instance in very sparsely populated areas, I'm going to take New Mexico for example, they've got 2 area codes that cover the entire state. We've got like 4 groups that want to exist there. And so in the past that's meant DCG 512-1 and -2 and -3 and -4. Or, ABCD. And that just doesn't make any sense. And so with this we are allowing groups to share and so yes they are going to represent that area code but they're going to represent the city Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Santa Fe, etcetera. Again, so that's in sparsely populated areas. And then, conversely, in densely populated areas, we have groups that are competing over one another. That we can allow them now to have groups. There may be groups in the various parts of the city or suburbs or smaller city name give you a group and not restrict you to an area code that will not work for a group. Here is an example I went and looked it up so you know DCG 011617 A. Sorry Brisbane don't wanna pick on you if we've got any representatives in here from from your group but I really think DCG Brisbane is more effective in terms of identification when you're wanting people to find you. Another thing that we've done is we've introduced group types. One of the common complaints that we heard is that the professionals in our industry or our community didn't really necessarily like being having a bunch of collegiate members and vice versa. They have opposite facing ideas of what the group should be and and the content of that. And it got to be to the point to where we had people just saying I'm not going to attend. You know, we had people saying that hey I want to take over this DCG in this town and I reached out to some of the people that I know in the community in that town, and it's like if you do that that's going to turn into just all academic, and no one's gonna lose interest and no one's gonna attend except for the college students. The purpose of DCG is try to be inclusive and reach as many people as possible. And, again we've had this issue as well with some government entities um in terms of military bases etcetera etcetera so we are making some exceptions on that. There will be some additional requirements required for academic and government groups. I'm not very creative, I'm sorry, I saw this on Reddit and people were complaining about the professional name. Hey I agree maybe I'm hoping instead of professional that the community term would be a a better name for that in terms of a group type. I am open to suggestions there. But at this point Community is probably the best thing that we've come up. I get you with professional. So not throwing any shade there. 

And then again new applications. I don't care if it's what group type it is, but new applications will be approved on a case by case basis. A lot of times there is certainly just “I don't like the group in my area and I want to form my own group”. That is not what we want. We want people working together. So when we have requests come in to form a group on top of another, we want to be respectful to that existing group. We want to encourage this new point of contact requesting the group to reach out to the existing group in the area. Can you work together? Can you find a way to coexist and be as one? And then if not you know ultimately our job is to you know make DEFCON groups available. And so if we can't come to consensus we will give out another group, but we do try to protect those existing groups as much as we can. The existing groups are meant to be granular, not regional. We've had lots of people that sense that if I go register a DCG group that is the entire country, that that's going to come with the prestige. No that's not what we're about. We want them to be regional, we want them to be local, we want them to be granular. So we will not create “super groups”. But what we will encourage is the groups that are in proximity to each other. We will encourage “hey work together contact and communicate with one another”. I know a lot of you do. I know there's examples of this out there. But we do encourage that and we do love that idea and that concept of working together and then coming together once a month. Say, “hey we're all gonna come to the center of the city,  we're all gonna meet here or there and have a big group meeting”.  So granular meetings here and there, and you know, maybe area type meetings every once in a while would be an awesome idea. We support that 100%. 

OK I'm going to move on through this quickly so we can get to discussions. Point of contact verification. So first and foremost, I just wanna reiterate first and last name, phone number, e-mail address. Information is used and collected for DEFCON use only. This is internal DEFCON use only. It's not sold. It's not put on the website. This is this is meant for us to have a valid confirmed communication channel with you should we need to reach your group. I'm going to just have to start here. I know that somebody said let's be real. So we're going to be real. DEFCON groups is no longer a party. It's evolved into a community. And that evolution into a community comes with responsibility. And we have to have responsibility for growth in our community, and we have to be responsible for the members in our community. So one of the things that you know people question “well what does DEFCON groups give me?” For a lot of people it gives them automatic perception of being a leader in their industry and they use that to their advantage. They use that to have endorsements and bad faith actors. And so we see this time and time again. We work against it. But it's sometimes we're chasing ghosts. We've had people we've had people that we've disbanded that have come back with a different e-mail on a different name. We've had that happen several times. Like, no, dude, look this is this is you again. Come you know come on give us a little bit of credit here. But, in general, we can't, without some form of additional verification, we cannot stop that from happening. And so yes we closed one group down, he comes back with a different name and a different e-mail, and applies for a group in a neighboring city and then goes out and does the same damn thing. And so you know this just helps us tried to prevent that. And when I say protect the community a lot of people have questioned how are you going to protect the community? You know we can't protect it in its entirety, but we can at least try our best to make efforts to protect it. So again let's be 100% honest yes these changes go to protect the reputation of DEFCON and the DEFCON groups community. And what an action of one has the potential of affecting us all. And that's what we were seeing. We don't want that to happen. I know that one of the questions I saw, I saw someone post, that we see this as a liability for you guys in terms of being a group. And that's why I asked. I find a little bit of irony there because that is what we are seeing too. We may be coming at it from two different perspectives, but we were for certain trying to reduce any liability. Yes, we're protecting DEFCON. But we're protecting your group as well. If you as a DEFCON group out there are part of the DEFCON brand, we're protecting all of us. That is our intent. We're not doing this to punish or control anyone. You know we've read that online. We don't want any control, we don't want any centralization. But you know at the end of the day if you're going to be operating under the DEFCON brand we at least need to know who you are and to know how to be able to communicate with you. And so again we're not trying to punish or control anyone and honestly, we don't see how this affects how any groups are currently operating. We're not asking anyone to operate any differently except for be connected with us and say hey I'm here. I'm here if you need me, and at the same time we're here if you need us. And final point on this is that this change was not made as a result of the recent lawsuit. Sure, you can probably connect some dots there if you want to, but this was this this was not a result of that lawsuit. 

Things that we've learned as we've been in this position? Reports of fake DEFCON conferences, and then this is probably the most important thing out of all, and this is the driving force behind this, but reports of serious misconduct. And I'm talking serious misconduct in terms of it makes code of conduct violations look like a game of pattycake. And so again I reflect back to this role of credibility and people potentially using the brand that that you're a part of for their for their own personal and ugly purposes. And so this was not isolated to any one group. We've had I don't know how many reports of it throughout the entire globe, and so that's when we put our foot down and said we've got to do something. So it is not acceptable. Or, we ask ourselves, is it acceptable to not know the identity of a point of contact in charge of a group representing DEFCON? 

I don't wanna seem cliche when I say this but I have been part of the hacker community for I believe 15 years now. I understand our roots, and I understand where we came from. We've discussed and thrown around all sorts of different options and ultimately these were the things that that worked. We received feedback from current point of contacts and ultimately once we arrived at the decision to make these changes they were brought to the DC staff and approved by DT. Again, I don't want to sound cliché, it was a difficult choice. But considering that this is our community and something that we're all a part of I think our team chose “human first”. When it came to when it came to some of these issues “human first” and “hacker second”. We're still hackers, but we're humans at heart, and we can't let some of the things that going on continue. 

So, I've tried to rush through that as quickly as possible. Thank you for listening to that and we will turn this over to start fielding some questions, here.

*Moderator*

All right so I have a couple questions for me that I've noted from the chat. I think the question that's probably most relevant I'll start with this one first how do you protect the point of contact information? 

*Adam*

Correct so that is going into I think we're using in in terms of reasonable protection right this isn't Fort Knox this isn't credit card data this is information that um you know quite honestly we give more information when we order Grubhub than what we're collecting. But we do realize that this is you know your information and we are cognizant of that. We will work as hard as we can to protect that and so right now it's being filled in a spreadsheet that is password protected and stored on DEFCON resources. 

*Moderator*

Yeah the second question. I'm going to paraphrase this a little bit just to make it a little bit more yeah I'm gonna paraphrase. So how do you know that the person that you're verifying is the person that you're verifying? So if I come to you to verify that I'm a POC and I give you the name Bob McKenzie how do you know that I am Bob McKenzie?

*Alethe*

So this is something that we struggled with for I'm not exaggerating years so I've been a member of this department since just over 2 years ago but only recently one of the leads. And we talked about how we would verify the identity of the people who were taking the point of contact position in a group because we’re receiving reports that point of contacts were acting in ways that were not acceptable by Deacon standards based on the code of conduct, and the only way that we could figure to verify somebody's identification was with the government ID. Now we debated this heavily amongst ourselves and we took this point to people in the community that we have known for a long time who've been part of the DEFCON community for a long time, and before discussing it with the Dark Tangent and other members of DEFCON staff and having this approved as a method of verifying point of contacts for DEFCON group leadership. It was heavily debated amongst our team because we wanted to find another way.  

*Adam*

Yeah

*Alethe*

Asking anybody to show us a government ID wasn't something that we were fans of we're trying to be real here and we're trying to be honest. It wasn't something that made us happy but it was the only way that we could figure to verify somebody and their legitimate identification. So that is what we settled on, was a photo government issued photoID to verify their name.

*Adam*

And to this comment right there that was one of the things that we discussed like hackers have never faked an ID before absolutely you realize we realize that right.

*Alethe*

I want to be clear that absolutely no lawyers were involved in any of this decision making process. There were no lawyers involved. None of this had anything to do with any lawsuits whatsoever. These were all decisions that were made by our department with the best interests of our community at heart. As members of this community we genuinely want to help our community and protect the members of it. And there were people coming to us asking for help. Legitimately reporting point of contacts who were behaving badly. There’s no way for me to share with you those details without doxing the victims and sharing more details than anyone here is just like justified to have. But I want you to understand we are trying to be as transparent and open as possible, and we don't appreciate the way that we're being treated, but we are legitimately coming to you with all the reasons that we've tried to do this for the betterment of our community and without any animosity or negative feeling whatsoever.

In terms of fake ID's – yes, you know if you or somebody goes to (those links to) fake your identity for a DEFCON group? I mean did we expect it to maybe have happened, or do we expect it to maybe happen? It's been discussed, but at the end of the day, in in our hearts and our minds, we're at least taking a step to try to prevent the things that we were seeing, and to try to prevent those from happening. Are we going to be 100% successful in doing that? No. But can we be 80% successful? I think we can, or more. But we're doing our due diligence in terms of taking those steps to correct something that we see as bad.
